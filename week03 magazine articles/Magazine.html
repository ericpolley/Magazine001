            <p> Great! I have developed a grid and set up a magizine style page with text and images. <br /><br/>
                This is a big step; <br /><br/>
                as I imagine most of what will be made in JavaScript will be using a mixture of
                Flexbox and CSS Grids. I will make a few projects to get comfortable will the idea.
                <br/>
                For now. Take a a gander at how I am able to copy text, and then repeat it to make it appear
                as though there is some content here. <br />

        <div class="boxes box7">Well Said!<br /> I could put it better myself. This is a test though. Might as well take a moment to practice my typing skills. It is all about speed with typing. Then again, what good is speed if your accuracy is off. 
        I guess it is a bit of a balance. Well, either way. Practice makes perfect. <br /> After this I think I will take a break <br /> I'm just really trying to make sure I post somewthing on GitHub every day. It is a Goal not a requirement, at this point.
